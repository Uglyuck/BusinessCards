<h2><b>Tiny games, Big Ideas*</b></h2>
Dynamic levels with logic built in to keep impossible routes from happening. This code was built to fit on the back of a business card and natively compile in C++ on any machine.

</br>
Instead of going with the 40x35 template I make this a little larger at 42x39 or 1638 bytes giving myself 238 more bytes to ensure the logic wouldn't create an impossible level, to allow enemy animation, and to ensure whoever plays it 
will be able to see the same image and not adjust any console defaults. 
<br><br>
This required research on the default character encoding of the console (437), along with looking up various codes on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437">Wiki</a> and encoding and decoding of character 
sets and various ways to initialize characters.
<br><br>
This challenge is to use as little code as possible for the maximum result, and to see how much I can push the limits to how small code can be made to make something work universally within the C language. 
Leaving the file-size to compile as small as possible, and as portable as possible.
This could have many uses: quick loading and small file size for dynamic compiling at runtime, transfer of information, or simply a small challenge to see how small you can get a popular game genre to natively run anywhere using C.
<br>
<br>
This is part of a small trend that is slowly moving by some wonderful and highly talented people and a couple people worth mentioning are <a href="https://frankforce.com/?p=5826">Frank Force</a> and his April fool's post about Tiny Ski (that actually works) and his first person raycasting engine, and <a href="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2016-01-12-card/">Andrew Kesnsler</a>'s raytracing.

<h2>About the game:</h2>
<left><div align=left>
<br><br>
Story:
<br>
<ul><li>
You might have heard this but you are a character. And that is decimal number 129 but you don't feel like you. You wake up realizing someone put a hex
on you, a 0x81 hex to be exact! You think you have changed so to restore, you heard there's an exception at the end of the rooms that will change who you are. You have to go for it. You must traverce the rooms in
 attempts to remove the hex. There are 100 rooms within the bounds of this existance and once you go outside of those bounds the exception occurs, will you make it out of the bounds of this reality 
to remove the hex or are you doomed to live not knowing if you will ever become the wonderful 129 character you thought you were.
</li></ul></br></br>
How to Play:
<ul><li>
Your are U and nobody can take that away from you. Oh except for O.<br><br>
</li></ul></br>

</br>
Controls:</br>
<ul> <li>Arrow keys to move.
</li><li>Enter to restart (on game over.)
</li><li>Escape key to close


</li></ul></br></br>Objects:
<UL>
<li> Omega: A portal on the top left and bottom right, collide with them to transport to the other end. (There's no Alpha here, because you are the Alpha.)
</li><li> $: the key for you to open the door to the next level. Upon collection a Door will appear in bright white.
</li><li> Door/bright light: Go towards the light when you see it. Enter the door to go to the next level.
</li></ul>

</br>
</br>
</br>Enemies:
<ul></li><li> The big O (and little o). Touching one of these will kill you instantly. (This also can be true in programming at times.)
</ul></br>
